## What is this?

When you need to quickly copy a file from a computer to another, what would you do?

- Use a USB stick and copy-pasting twice? With that slow thing? No no no!
- Google Drive? Ngl every Google app is laggy AF. Every click costs a few seconds.
- Use sites like Google Drive? Or maybe just send files through messaging apps? Nah there are too many limit, and they have that "antivirus" thing.
- Torrent? Who the hell create a torrent for one-time use lol.

And that's why I created this abomination:
